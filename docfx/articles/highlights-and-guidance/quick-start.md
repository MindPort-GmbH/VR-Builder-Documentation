## Quick Start

You can check out the main features of this add-on in the provided demo scene. After importing the package in a properly set-up VR Builder project, you can access the demo scene from the menu `Tools > VR Builder > Demo Scenes > Highlights and Guidance`. It is necessary to open the demo scene from the menu at least the first time, so a script will copy the required process file in the `StreamingAssets` folder.

// TODO update this

The demo scene consists of a color mixing machine. The user adds bottles of color in the machine to mix a new color, then can press the button to spawn a ball of the created color. It uses the data properties included in this add-on for storing and calculating the mixed color, while the machine is controlled by states.

You can press Play to try out the scene, or open the Process Editor to check out how the process is made.

Additionally, you can find a tutorial on how this demo scene was created on our [website](https://www.mindport.co/vr-builder-learning-path/how-to-create-a-color-mixing-machine-in-vr).
