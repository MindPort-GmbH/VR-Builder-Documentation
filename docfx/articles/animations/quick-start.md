## Quick Start
The easiest way to get started with this add-on is to check out the included demo scene.

If it is the first time you open the demo scene, you will have to do it through the menu: `Tools > VR Builder > Demo Scenes > Animations`. This is necessary as a script will copy the demo course in the StreamingAssets folder. After the first time, the demo scene can be opened normally.

Press Play to try out the behaviors included in this add-on. The demo scene includes a station for every behavior. You can teleport there and check out some practical uses of the included behaviors.
