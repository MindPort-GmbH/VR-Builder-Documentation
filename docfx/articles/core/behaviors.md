## Behaviors

Behaviors are used to make something happen in the process. Behaviors can be as simple as giving instructions and hints, making new objects visible, or animating an object in the scene. What they have in common is that something happens without requiring an intervention by the user. This section lists the behaviors included in VR Builder.
