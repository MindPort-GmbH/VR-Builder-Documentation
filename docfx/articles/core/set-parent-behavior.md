### Set Parent

#### Description

The Set Parent behavior parents an `Object` to another one in the Unity hierarchy.

#### Configuration

- **Target**

    The `Process Scene Object` to be parented.

- **Parent**

    The new parent for the target object. Note this can be null, in which case the object will be unparented.

- **Snap to parent transform**

If checked, the target object will snap to the same position and rotation as the parent object.
