## Requirements

### VR Builder 5
VR Builder 5 is supported for Unity 6.0 or later. It uses the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) by default. Using the Built-In Render Pipeline is still possible, but you will need to replace solid magenta material shaders, such as those on controller models in the Rig.

VR Builder works out of the box with any headset compatible with Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit 3.x.
