## Requirements

VR Builder supports Unity 6 or later. It uses the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) by default. Using the Built-In Render Pipeline is still possible, but you will need to replace invalid material shaders, such as those on controller models in the Rig.

If you are using an older Unity version, we recommend to fall back to VR Builder 4.x which officially supports versions prior to Unity 6.

VR Builder works out of the box with any headset compatible with Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit 3.x.
