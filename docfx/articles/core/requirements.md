## Requirements

### VR Builder 5
VR Builder 5 is supported for Unity 6.0 or later. It uses the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) by default. Using the Built-In Render Pipeline is still possible, but you will need to replace solid magenta material shaders, such as those on controller models in the Rig.

VR Builder works out of the box with any headset compatible with Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit 3.x.

### VR Builder 4
The old VR Builder 4 is supported on Unity 2021.3 through Unity 2022.3. It uses the Built-In Render Pipeline by default, but URP is also supported, and existing materials can be easily converted.

VR Builder works out of the box with any headset compatible with Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit 2.x.
