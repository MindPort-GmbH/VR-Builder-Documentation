## Acknowledgements

VR Builder is based on the open source edition of the [Innoactive Creator](https://github.com/Innoactive/Creator). While
Innoactive helps enterprises to scale VR training, we adopted this tool to provide value for smaller content creators
looking to streamline their VR development processes.

Like Innoactive, we believe in the value of open source and will continue to support this approach together with them
and the open source community.
This means you are welcome to contribute to the [VR Builder GitHub repositories](https://github.com/MindPort-GmbH).
