## XR Rig

The XR Rig is a game object that anchors the user’s head mounted display, controllers, or user’s hands when using hand tracking within the virtual space. You also configure which types of locomotion and interaction are available to the user.

### VR Builder XR Rig

When creating a new scene with the VR Builder Scene Setup Wizard, you get a `VRB_XR_Setup` game object automatically added to the scene. `VRB_XR_Setup` is the VR Builder XR Rig and is built upon the suggested standards set by the Unity XR Interaction Toolkit. Therefore, `VRB_XR_Setup` is very similar to the `XR Origin (XR Rig)` found in the XR Interaction Toolkit samples but has some additional VR Builder–specific scripts added.
