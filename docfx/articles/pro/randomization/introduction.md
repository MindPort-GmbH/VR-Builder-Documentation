## Introduction

The Randomization add-on makes it easy to add unpredictability to a VR Builder process. It includes a new type of node, called Random Branch, which allows to add random events and alternative paths with zero effort.
Additionally, there are a couple tools to work with data properties: behaviors to set random booleans and numbers. You can use these to set random values for the process, and compare those values in condition, to make sure that every run of a process will be different than last time.
