## Quick Start

You can check out the main features of this add-on in the provided demo scene. After importing the package in a properly set-up VR Builder project, you can access the demo scene from the menu `Tools > VR Builder > Demo Scenes > Highlights and Guidance`. It is necessary to open the demo scene from the menu at least the first time, so a script will copy the required process file in the `StreamingAssets` folder.

The demo scene in this add-on is pretty simple and requires no interaction from the user. Once the scene is started, the user will find themselves in front of three cylinder shapes. These will be highlighted one by one with different highlight styles, while a voice explains what is happening. At the same time, an arrow near the feet of the user will point to the relevant cylinder.

You can press Play to try out the scene, or open the Process Editor to check out how the process is made.
