## Introduction

The Highlights and Guidance add-on provides a variety of tools to highlight important objects in the scene, direct the user towards them and otherwise show the user the path forward.

While VR Builder does include a functional Highlight Objects behavior, this add-on aims to provide more options letting you better customize your guidance and ultimately produce a better, more professional-looking application.
