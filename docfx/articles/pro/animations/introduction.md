## Introduction
This add-on contains a collection of animation behaviors that allow VR Builder to display more complex animations than what is possible with the built-in tools.

When installed, the `Move Object` core behavior will be disabled in the menu, as its functionality is 100% included in the new `Animate Transform` behavior. To manually enable it, go to `Tools > VR Builder > Developer > Allowed Menu Items Configuration`.
