## Quick Start

Drag one of the prefabs in the `Prefabs` folder in your process scene. The menu will appear when pressing Play. Feel
free to try it out with the demo scene included in VR Builder!

The process starts automatically in VR Builder. If you want the process to be started from the menu, you will have to
provide a custom `[PROCESS_CONTROLLER]`. You can find more information on how to do
so [here](customizing-process-controller.md).
