## Quick Start

1. Search for the two prefabs `DesktopProcessControllerMenu`or `StandaloneProcessControllerMenu` in the Project explorer or go to the directory `Packages/VR Builder Pro/StaticAssets/Prefabs`
2. Drag one or both UI prefabs in your process scene. 
3. The menu will appear when pressing Play.
4. Feel free to try it out with the demo scene included in VR Builder!

The process starts automatically in VR Builder. If you want the process to be started from the menu, you will have to provide a custom `[PROCESS_CONTROLLER]`. You can find more information on how to do so [here](customizing-process-controller.md).
