## Introduction

This add-on provides examples on how to build a menu that allows to control the process execution in VR Builder. The
menu allows to display the current step and its description, skip it by choosing a transition, switch chapters or
restart the process.

Two prefabs are included. One displays the menu on the desktop screen, allowing an external person to control the
process. This can be useful for example in training scenarios with a trainee in VR and a trainer at the computer.
The other displays the menu in VR, floating in front of the user. This can be useful for standalone headsets, which lack
a flat screen view, or in cases where the user is supposed to control the process themselves.
