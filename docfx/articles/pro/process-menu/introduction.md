## Introduction

This add-on provides examples on how to build a menu that allows to control the process execution in VR Builder. The menu allows to display the current step and its description, skip it by choosing a transition, switch chapters or restart the process. 

Two prefabs are included ([DesktopProcessControllerMenu](how-to-use.md#desktop-process-menu) and [StandaloneProcessControllerMenu](how-to-use.md#standalone-process-menu)). One displays the menu on the desktop screen, allowing an external person to control the process. This can be useful, for example, in training scenarios with a trainee in VR and a trainer at the computer.
The other displays the menu in VR, floating in front of the user. This can be useful for standalone headsets, which lack a flat screen view, or in cases where the user is supposed to control the process themselves.
