## Introduction

The States and Data add-on provides developers the tools to create processes more complex and customized than before.

Thanks to the support of variables in the VR Builder process, it is possible to store values to create triggers or track performance, and to create branching processes with a variety of outcomes.

The states feature allows VR Builder process to interact with objects in the scene by changing and reading states instead of handling all the object's logic. This allows the user to quickly write custom code and easily integrate it in the VR Builder process, opening the way to endless customization and better performance.
